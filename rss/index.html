Deploying the branch takes almost an hour because of the complexity of our application. We did not want to trigger the deployment for each commit since it is a costly process. So we put a block step for the deployment part in the pull request pipeline. However, developers sometimes forgot to unblock this step when the task was ready for testing. It means I will have to wait for an hour to start testing when a branch is not deployed but ready for testing. I know it is not the best solution and it does not solve all the problems completely but I came up with a quick improvement:</p><p>We use the id of the related Jira task while naming a branch. I wrote a small script to send an API request to Jira with the branch name and checked the status of the task. If the task is not in the &quot;Ready for QA&quot; or &quot;In QA&quot; sections, then I added the block step. As a result, when the task is in the testing phase, the deployment to the test environments initiates automatically.</p><pre><code class="language-YAML"> - label: &quot;Deploy to staging if the task is in the testing phase&quot;
    key: &quot;auto-deploy&quot;
    command: python check_jira_status.py
    soft_fail: true

  - wait: ~

  - command : |
      if [ $$(buildkite-agent step get &quot;outcome&quot; --step &quot;auto-deploy&quot;) == &quot;soft_failed&quot; ]; then
        cat &lt;&lt;- YAML | buildkite-agent pipeline upload
        steps:
          - block: &quot;:rocket: Deploy it!&quot;
      YAML
      fi
  
  - wait: ~</code></pre><p>Thus, I was able to add a conditional block step and save the time we lost when we forgot to unblock the deployment step. This was especially great for the commits made during the testing phase. As I said before, it does not solve all the problems; if the task is moved to the testing phase after a commit, I still need to unblock the step manually. I am also planning to trigger the deployment when the task status is changed by using Jira webhooks. However, I didn&apos;t have time to do that, so I applied the quickest solution for now. I also wanted to share this with you because the conditional blocking step is not clearly explained in the Buildkite documentation. I hope it helps for you too.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to change the admin password of your local Ghost Blog setup]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>It&apos;s been almost two years since I purchased the domain qualityaddict.com and set up a Ghost blogging platform on my local machine.

During this time, I&apos;ve drafted several blog posts, but I didn&apos;t feel they are ready for publication, so I put off on launching my website until now.</p><p>However, today was the day I finally decided to publish QualityAddict.com. Excitedly, I attempted to log in to the local admin dashboard, only to hit a major roadblock&#x2014;I couldn&apos;t remember my password! Despite trying every possible combination, I couldn&apos;t sign into the dashboard. Of course, I hadn&apos;t configured an SMTP server for my local setup, which meant I couldn&apos;t utilize the forgot password flow.</p><p>There was only one option left: updating the password directly from the database! Let me explain step by step so if I forget again in the future I would be able to reset it quickly!</p><p>Download the password.js file from their repository: <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Utils/blob/main/packages/security/lib/password.js?ref=localhost">https://github.com/TryGhost/Utils/blob/main/packages/security/lib/password.js</a></p><p>Fortunately, they don&apos;t store passwords as plain teTherefore, we need to hash the new password string just as they do. Their code look like as below, but it&apos;s crucial to ensure that you&apos;re using the most updated version.</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">const Promise = require(&apos;bluebird&apos;);

module.exports.hash = function hash(plainPassword) {
    const bcrypt = require(&apos;bcryptjs&apos;);
    const bcryptGenSalt = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.genSalt);
    const bcryptHash = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.hash);

    return bcryptGenSalt().then(function (salt) {
        return bcryptHash(plainPassword, salt);
    });
};

module.exports.compare = function compare(plainPassword, hashedPassword) {
    const bcrypt = require(&apos;bcryptjs&apos;);
    const bcryptCompare = Promise.promisify(bcrypt.compare);

    return bcryptCompare(plainPassword, hashedPassword);
};</code></pre><p>Currently, we need to install the following dependencies to run the code above:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">npm install bluebird
npm install bcryptjs</code></pre><p>Then create a file named <strong>generatePassword.js</strong></p><pre><code class="language-javascript">require(&apos;./password&apos;).hash(process.argv[2]).then(console.log);</code></pre><blockquote><strong>Password.js</strong> and <strong>generatePassword.js</strong> should be located in the same directory.</blockquote><p>We can hash strings right now, for example:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">node generatePassword.js &quot;test123&quot;</code></pre><p>You will see the hashed version of the string in the console.</p><p>We need to replace the password field with the new one in the database record, but the question arises: where is the database located?</p><p>Let&apos;s check the <strong>config.development.json </strong>file:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript">  &quot;database&quot;: {
    &quot;client&quot;: &quot;sqlite3&quot;,
    &quot;connection&quot;: {
      &quot;filename&quot;: &quot;/home/..../ghost-local.db&quot;
    }
  }</code></pre><p>As you can see, it uses a local database solution named sqlite3 and we can easily connect it:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">sqlite3 /home/..../ghost-local.db</code></pre><p>Finally, we can replace the password by running the following query:</p><pre><code class="language-bash">UPDATE users
  SET
    password = &apos;NEW_PASSWORD_HASH&apos;
  WHERE id = 1;</code></pre><p>So we can sign into the dasboard with your new password!</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
